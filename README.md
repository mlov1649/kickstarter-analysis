# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

### Purpose
Deliverable 1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart
Deliverable 2: Outcomes Based on Goals Chart


### Analysis of Outcomes

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Fundraiser goals are most likely to be successful in the first half of the year. 
Throughout the year, projects are more likely to be successful than to fail. 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Projects under 1000 have the greatest rate of success. 
Projects between $10,000 and $35,000 are more likely to fail. 
Pojects between $40,000 and $45,000 is the sweet spot. 


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Though the average donation and backers count might suggest it, the dataset does not include the median donaton amount which would be another helpful metric to chart. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a graph that shows the success rate based on the backer's count and average donation.
